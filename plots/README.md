## Plots

# Objective:

In this project, I will implement a single-page application utilizing the Vue framework. The application will allow users to add datapoints to a "table" of data. Utilizing the d5.js library, these datapoints will be plotted on an x-y plot. The plot should be updated everytime that a datapoint is added  

Users will be able to modify the title and some basic aspects of the plot, like series color.  Utilizing the SPA, uses will be able to edit and delete datapoints.

I will also investigate the usage of tables in single point applications and implement it to make the page look more professional.

If time allows, I will invetigate allowing uses to add multiple series on the same plot.s
