## Outside resources
For the SPRs Table and sorting, I followed the example in the following page:
[https://www.developerdrive.com/creating-a-data-table-in-vue-js/](https://www.developerdrive.com/creating-a-data-table-in-vue-js/)

For the database update functionality, I used sample code from the following:
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53480572/having-trouble-updating-a-document-in-vue-js-using-firebases-firestore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53480572/having-trouble-updating-a-document-in-vue-js-using-firebases-firestore)
          
I used a codepen example for radio buttons:

## Notes for instructor
I need to figure out the proper use of *.then()* promise as it caused errors when I didn't use the *response*.
